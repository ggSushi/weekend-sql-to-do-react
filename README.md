### **_SQL To-Do App_**
This app aims to help the user create their own to-do list, allowing them to create new tasks, check them off if they are completed, and delete them individually if no longer needed.

---
### **_Setup_**
Please include a `database.sql` text file in your repo that includes all of your `CREATE TABLE` queries. This is so we can re-create your database while testing your app.

You will need to run

```
npm install
npm run server
npm run client
```
